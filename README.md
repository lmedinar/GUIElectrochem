# ElectrochemGrapher

**ElectrochemGrapher** is a **Python + PyQt5** application that simulates and plots current‚Äìpotential (I‚ÄìE) curves based on the models presented in the early chapters of *Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications (2nd Ed.)* by **Allen J. Bard** and **Larry R. Faulkner**.

> ‚ö° This project was created as an educational tool to visualize different **electrochemical response cases**, helping students bridge theory and experimental intuition.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Simple and intuitive **graphical interface** (PyQt5).
- Simulation of **six classical cases** of electrochemical responses for solutions under constant agitation with different conditions for oxidants (O) and reductants (R):
  - **Case A:** R absent, O present.  
  - **Case B:** Both O and R present initially.  
  - **Case C:** R present, O absent.  
  - **Case D:** R insoluble.  
  - **Case E:** Complexing agent Y affects O (reversible reactions).  
  - **Case F:** Agent Y facilitates irreversible reactions.  
- Configurable parameters:
  - Number of electrons in the reaction (*n*).  
  - Electrode area.  
  - Mass transfer coefficients.  
  - Initial concentrations.  
  - Standard potential E¬∞'.  
- Interactive **matplotlib plots** with automatic annotations of key parameters (e.g., $E_{1/2}$, $I_{LC}$).  
- **Bilingual interface**: Spanish and English.  
- Portable **Windows executable (.exe)** built with PyInstaller.
